    <p>
      A solitary knight embarks on a journey to a distant land. Horrible monsters, fearsome demons and mysterious companions await. 
      Will its sword be sharp enough to cut through his enemies and his shield strong enough to protect whom he vowed to defend? 
      Even without certainties, one still needs to go forward.
